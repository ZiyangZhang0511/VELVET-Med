# VELVET-Med: Vision and Efficient Language Pre-training for Volumetric Imaging Tasks in Medicine

pretrain.py for pre-training

train_dt.py for training on various downstream tasks

Files under modeling is for building models such as TriBERT (written as SentBERT) as well as SSL models.

Files under datasets is for building torch-style Dataset class over pre-training and downstrean datasets.

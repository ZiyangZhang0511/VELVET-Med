# VELVET-Med: Vision and Efficient Language Pre-training for Volumetric Imaging Tasks in Medicine

pretrain.py for pre-training

train_dt.py for training on various downstream tasks

Files under modeling are for building models such as TriBERT (written as SentBERT) as well as SSL models.

Files under datasets are for building torch-style Dataset class over pre-training and downstrean datasets.

Files under config_ssl are configuration files for differing pre-training combination.

Files under config_dt are configuration files for differing downstream tasks.
